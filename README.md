Welcome to my general rust tinker space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. This is where I accumulate miscellaneous rust projects
. As something matures,
	I may migrate it somewhere more structured.
. There is a DUMP here for processing.
. There are some working logs and miscellany
. These are resources and tricks I collect
. An idea will live in it's own directory,
	until it matures into its own repo, or not.
